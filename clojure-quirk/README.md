Clojure-quirk implementation - Pol Ajazi CSC521

This assignment was attempted up to example3. 

I have not been able to create a clojure-quirk project because I thought I could simply 
rename the directory; then I tried to make a new one with eclipse and copy all of the files
by hand from the compiled 'instaparsetest' version but that didn't work, and when I deleted
that Eclipse file, Eclipse didn't let me create another qurik-clojure file. The first one
must exist somewhere, but I ran out of time to try and find it.

I have not had time to comment all of the functions or the print statements, but the 
correct output should always be the last line.
The version of Clojure my Eclipse Clockwork downloaded is currently buggy, so it will not 
format the code for me in any way. 

I'm sorry for the above, but I was spending what time I had left from the day's exam to 
figure out how to implement a solution for example4.q. By the time I looked at the clock,
it was already too late and I had to roll out all the changes to number 4 in order to 
prevent the previous three versions from crashing.

The input should be as as specified, except that you have to be inside instaparsetest, which
is located inside clojure-quirk. 
The following command from the csc521 dir should work:

	cd clojure-quirk/instaparsetest

Then:	lein run -pt < example1.q (for parse tree) 

or:	lein run <example1.q (no parse tree)

Thank you for taking the time to grade this, Arun, and Professor McCoy. Have a great summer
to you both and I'll see you  next semester.
